# Sisyfos

Sisyfos is an experimental project, where I try to use Ada to create a turn-based-strategy game engine that can be played by 2-3 players on a LAN – network.
There is both a PolyORB version, and a socket version.

In this repository you also will find the demo-game Tubast'ga, that uses Sisyfos.

Some more information is in the documents of the project.

This projects is in development.
